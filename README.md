# 🧠 Falcon-7B Instruct Chatbot

This project demonstrates a simple conversational AI chatbot built using the **Falcon-7B Instruct** model from Hugging Face. The chatbot runs in a Jupyter Notebook, responds to user prompts interactively via the terminal, and maintains conversational context.

---

## 📌 Features

- Uses [tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct) for high-quality text generation
- Maintains chat history for multi-turn conversation
- Runs locally with Hugging Face's `transformers` and `torch`
- Supports text sampling with configurable decoding strategies

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

### 3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Run the Chatbot

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Chatbot.ipynb

Or convert to script and run in terminal:

python scripts/chatbot.py

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

    Language Model: Falcon-7B Instruct (tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct)

    Libraries:

        transformers (for model + tokenizer)

        torch (for inference)

        accelerate (for device placement)

    Platform: Jupyter Notebook / Python CLI

## 🧪 Example Conversation
